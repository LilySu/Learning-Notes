              "0  I must say, we were excited to try this restaurant tonight. It looked like a lot of great reviews. We did make reservations and I would strongly recommend. My daughter (age 11) and I were seating in the Atrium, which was very nice, and light (even though it was raining and gloomy). The servers took a little bit to come over, but once they did, service was impeccable. It was more of a service by committee and everyone of the team was pleasant and attentive. Let's go to the food. We started with tomato soup and a kale caesar salad. Both were excellent. We had the gnocchi and lamb for entrees. The gnocchi were very pleasant taste and the texture was nice. The lamb was cooked beautifully, a little fatty, but delicious! Potatoes and veg needed a little more seasoning, but that is being very picky. I ordered the Anything Goes and it was superb. Ranks up there on one of my favorite finds in NYC.   \n",

              "0  I must say, we were excited to try this restaurant tonight. It looked like a lot of great reviews. We did make reservations and I would strongly recommend. My daughter (age 11) and I were seating in the Atrium, which was very nice, and light (even though it was raining and gloomy). The servers took a little bit to come over, but once they did, service was impeccable. It was more of a service by committee and everyone of the team was pleasant and attentive. Let's go to the food. We started with tomato soup and a kale caesar salad. Both were excellent. We had the gnocchi and lamb for entrees. The gnocchi were very pleasant taste and the texture was nice. The lamb was cooked beautifully, a little fatty, but delicious! Potatoes and veg needed a little more seasoning, but that is being very picky. I ordered the Anything Goes and it was superb. Ranks up there on one of my favorite finds in NYC.   \n",

              "8   am writing new review in October of 2019 My husband very disappointed in our visit to Bea past Sunday The meal in no longer all you can eat small plates get expensive there's a lot of waste The new brunch is a 23 price fixe which realize is not much in NYC but quality not there anymore we rushed through meal with several plates arriving at once not really hot Since we reservations for 11 am restaurant not yet crowded so know what rush for The wait staff professional but plates presented sloppily overall not a pleasant experience What really provoked me to write update 10 00 charged for two cups of tea Tea here is per order you pay for every cup you ask for nothing is said by server to warn you While my husband enjoyed refills of coffee one very weak tea bag no idea would be charged again for second request suppose realize that a simple Red Rose tea bag is 18 scolded Manager doubt he cared but my husband are scratching Bea off our list What a shame   \n",
